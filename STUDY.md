# Bootcamp Review Notes

## User Story
As a full stack bootcamp student
I want an organized website of notes
So that I can refer to them during class.


## Acceptance Criteria
Given a Bootcamp Study Guide website 

When I look for my notes
Then I find sections organized by Date
When I view the title of an element
Then I find the corresponding workflow / guide
When I have more notes from class, homework, or self-study
Then I can upload the notes with pictures and sources
